<!-- In our Property Tracker application: -->

<!-- Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the Property class? -->
in the console
<!-- Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby Property object into the database? -->
in the database folder
<!-- Q3. In console.rb, which lines modify the database? -->
lines that call functions on the objects
<!-- Q4. Why do we not define the id of a Property object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)? -->
because we need to put the objects into the table for the id to be generated

<!-- Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby Property object? -->
in the create part of crud, in the save function by assigning it to the first ([0]) value to the in initialize
<!-- Q6. Why do we put a guard (an if clause) on the @id attribute in the constructor? --> incase sql setup does not require the table to have id

<!-- Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods? -->
some functions require the whole table where others only look to access a column or row
<!-- Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to db.exec_prepared()? In the save method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure? -->
an array is returned and can be accessed via the index
<!-- Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations? -->
to stop people putting in values that could be malicious
